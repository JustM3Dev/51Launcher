# 51 Launcher
A small game launcher mady by [51Devs](https://51devs.xyz/). Why not Steam? I dont even know. We were bored.

<br>

## Description
This is a project made by the 51Devs developers. If you have any questions, be sure to contact us [here](https://51devs.xyz/#feedback "Our feedback")

<br>

## About
This is a game launcher made in order to publish, update and launch our own [games](https://51devs.xyz/games/). It was manly made by [JustMe](https://github.com/JustM3Dev) If you have any suggestions or issues with it, please open a new issue in the issues tab. I hope y'all have fun playing our games and looking at our code.

<br>

## How
This launcher was made using [Electron](https://electronjs.org "HTML, CSS and JS Desktop framework mady by Github"). Since I was unable to get a custom login system working in the deadline, you can only login using Google. The launcher is able to update itself. If you have logged in successfully you should be able to go to the "Store" tab and download a game.
